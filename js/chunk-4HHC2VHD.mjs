Handling large volumes of high-resolution images can be resource-intensive. To ensure fast load times and performance, we implemented:
	•	Automatic generation of multiple image resolutions (thumbnail, medium, original)
	•	Smart loading strategies (lazy loading, CDN support)
	•	Image compression using Sharp

 Cost-Effective Cloud Storage
Amazon S3 is reliable but often costly at scale. To reduce long-term storage expenses:
	•	We provided an optional integration with Wasabi Cloud Storage, offering S3-compatible APIs at a fraction of the cost.
	•	Users can choose between S3 and Wasabi based on their budget and needs.

 Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React.js with Redux
	•	Backend: Node.js with Express.js
	•	Database: PostgreSQL
	•	Image Processing: Sharp
	•	Cloud Storage: Wasabi

 Outcome
	•	Reduced operational overhead for photographers by automating key workflows
	•	Enhanced user experience with fast-loading, high-quality image galleries
	•	Lowered storage costs by over 60% with Wasabi integration
	•	Increased photographer visibility through customizable portfolio pages`

        [M]: `Dynamic Image Cropping & Integration
One of the biggest technical challenges in the project was dynamically cropping user-uploaded images to fit within different poster templates without affecting the layout or design quality. Since each template had predefined image boundaries, we needed a reliable way to:
	•	Allow users to crop or adjust their uploaded photo in real time
	•	Maintain aspect ratio and positioning for various screen sizes
	•	Seamlessly embed the processed image into a selected poster template

We addressed this by integrating a client-side cropping library and rendering the final poster using canvas-based image processing. This ensured:
	•	High-quality rendering
	•	Real-time preview capabilities
	•	Consistent results across templates and devices

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: Next.js (React-based), Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
	•	Email Service: SMTP / Mailgun integration for poster delivery
	•	Storage: Secure file handling with scalable backend architecture

Outcome
	•	Increased user engagement by transforming educational content into interactive experiences
	•	Generated thousands of custom posters, promoting hygiene awareness at the grassroots level
	•	Enabled real-time, mobile-friendly poster creation with minimal load times
	•	Supported both creative expression and social responsibility through an accessible toolset`

Solution Delivered

We delivered a full-stack, content-driven migration platform using Strapi (Headless CMS), Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL. The system offers real-time data, seamless user flows, and complete content management flexibility.

Skill Assessment Engine
Users can complete detailed assessments to understand which visa subclasses they qualify for based on skills, education, and work history.

Visa Types & Eligibility Checker
The platform displays detailed guides on various Australian visa categories (e.g., Skilled Migration, Student, Partner, Business), along with an automated eligibility test based on up-to-date immigration policies.

ANZSCO Search Integration
Built-in ANZSCO (Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations) search allows users to find relevant occupation codes and see their points-based eligibility in real time.

Purchase Migration Plans & Insurance
Users can browse and buy migration packages or international insurance directly from the website using a secure checkout system.`,

Dynamic Eligibility Logic
One of the most complex components was building a rule-based eligibility engine that dynamically evaluates user inputs (age, occupation, experience, etc.) and returns tailored visa options and points breakdown.

We solved this by:
	•	Designing a flexible rule engine schema in PostgreSQL
	•	Allowing admins to manage logic via Strapi
	•	Implementing real-time result rendering in the frontend with React

Accurate ANZSCO Mapping
ANZSCO codes are critical for skilled migration, and we needed to ensure accurate keyword-based matching and filtering.

We implemented:
	•	Full-text search and auto-complete on occupation titles
	•	Keyword indexing and synonym mapping for better search results

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend: Strapi Headless CMS (Node.js-based)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL
	•	Payment: Stripe integration for migration plans & insurance

Outcome
	•	Thousands of users have successfully used the platform for migration planning
	•	Drastically reduced manual inquiries by offering real-time skill test results and visa guides
	•	Enabled online revenue generation through digital migration packages and insurance products
	•	Delivered a scalable content management system that empowers admins to update rules, content, and plans without developer intervention`

The client wanted a vibrant, community-centric platform where travel lovers could:
	•	Create and share detailed travel journeys
	•	Post travel experiences with photos and captions
	•	Interact with others through likes, comments, and follows
	•	Discover other users' journeys for trip inspiration
	•	Visualize travel history and places visited on a map
	•	Provide a seamless, mobile-first UI for content creation and discovery

Solution Delivered
We delivered a fully functional social media platform designed for travelers with a strong focus on journey tracking, engagement, and location-based visualization.

Journey Creation & Exploration
Users can create multi-day journeys, each with destinations, posts, and experiences. Every journey can include:
	•	Day-by-day breakdown
	•	Photos, captions, and notes
	•	Visibility settings (public/private)

Other users can explore these journeys for travel inspiration, mark them as favorites, and even use them to plan their own.

Social Posting System

Users can publish standalone travel posts, like traditional social media. Each post supports:
	•	Media uploads (photos/videos)
	•	Hashtags and captions
	•	Like and comment functionality
	•	Linking to existing journeys

Interactive Map Visualization

Each user gets a personal map view that shows:
	•	All the places they’ve visited
	•	Pins of their posts or journeys
	•	Geographic filtering to explore new locations

This encourages travel storytelling through a visual-first experience.

Engagement & Community

The platform includes standard social features:
	•	Likes, comments, and shares on both posts and journeys
	•	Follow other travelers
	•	Notifications for new activity
	•	Personalized feed based on user interests and locations`,

Real-Time Map Plotting & Optimization
We faced performance challenges when plotting multiple posts and journeys on maps — especially with image-heavy content. To solve this:
	•	We used map clustering and lazy loading to optimize rendering
	•	Implemented geolocation tagging and reverse geocoding for precise location data
	•	Used Mapbox for high-performance map rendering

Scalable Media Handling
Since users upload high-resolution travel images, we implemented:
	•	On-the-fly image resizing & CDN caching
	•	File compression and optimization at upload
	•	Lazy loading with blurred preview thumbnails for smooth feed browsing

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend: Nest.js
	•	Database: PostgreSQL
	•	Maps: Mapbox / Google Maps API

Outcome
	•	Enabled hundreds of travelers to document and share their experiences
	•	Delivered an engaging and location-aware user experience
	•	Promoted community growth through content discovery and interaction
	•	Offered a mobile-first design for users on the go
	•	Created a platform that blends inspiration, planning, and storytelling`
